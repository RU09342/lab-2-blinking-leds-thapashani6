* Circuit completed in 10/10
* Extra work done in 10/12

### Code
The code used in this was simply the Multiple Blink from the previous lab. This could also only be performed on the G2553 since it had the only IC that could be removed from its board.

### Extra Work: Off-Board Programming
You can connect G2553 board through Test and Reset pins. Connect those from the header into the IC chip on the bread board. If done correctly, you can program the G2 on the breadboard from a computer.
